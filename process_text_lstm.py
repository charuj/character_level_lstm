'''
Code for processing text files for LSTM.

- Loads raw text data
- reads file
- converts character strings into integer IDs
- makes mini-batches with the inputs

Inspired by how Udacity's Tensorflow LSTM tutorial converts characters to IDs and vice versa.
See: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/6_lstm.ipynb
